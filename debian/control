Description: gnuradio based driver library for the USRP1 SDR
  Gnuradio removed libusrp as it switched to UHD support, including USRP1
  devices. However, USRP1 on UHD doesn't support timestamps, so this library
  remains needed for applications that use timestamps such as osmo-trx. To find
  out how this library was forked from gnuradio, check libusrp.git commit
  description ec6adccbbdda1a4614089aaf52f9e1bab75494e7.
